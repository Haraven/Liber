## Liber
This is the public repository for my [Django-based](https://www.djangoproject.com/) blog infrastructure.

## What am I going to see here?
For the most part, my progress as I write my own website from scratch.

## Why not just use something readymade if all you want is a blog?
I want to get my hands dirty with some programming that isn't Unity C# scripting, which I currently do for my day job. Plus, if all goes well, I will be able to say that the website is truly "mine".

## Why Django?
A friend back in university mentioned having worked in Django, and I was curious to see what it was about. Plus, on their website they advertise Django as being "the Web framework for perfectionists with deadlines", which sounds right up my alley. I don't want to invest too much time on infrastructure, but I want to get it right too.

## So, what are your intentions for this blog?
In a nutshell, my intention is to have it be a book about life.
That summary sounds sort of new-agey, but that is not necessarily my aim. I want to dedicate this blog to writing in a semi-formal manner about different facets of life/being; I intend to write about matters of the mind (intellectual topics), of the soul/psyche (topics of religion and psychology), of the body (physical health and fitness), of art, and of nature.

This writing style will be constrained by having it follow the format an empirical writing Ã  la books by [Carl G. Jung](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung). It will feature:

- English and Romanian versions of the website
- References
- Footnotes
- Paragraph numbers (persistent across different articles so that I can cross-reference)
- Audio version for each writing, available in both languages
